As u can see the comment below, I've almost done a keygen.
Technically I have uncovered how it validates the key, but i quit cuz it required me to bruteforce to find the correct key.

- equision: `(x - y)^2 + (((a - b) * (c - d)) * 0x88) = 0x660`
- range: 0x41~0x7A


I cant afford to waste time on that bruteforce.
